# NOSID
*An experimental operating system for the Commodore 64*

NOSID is an incomplete multi-tasking operating system for the Commodore 64.  It is a hobby project written entirely in (ACME) 6502 assembler.  While I may never revisit this project, it does work and writing it was a good learning experience.

Currently implemented:
 - OS loader
 - Scrolling console output with up to 4 virtual consoles
 - Task switching
 - Virtual 16-bit ALU (currently unused, but cool if needed)
 - System call architecture to fork, yield, and kill tasks
 
NOSID stands for "Naming Operating Systems Is Difficult".
